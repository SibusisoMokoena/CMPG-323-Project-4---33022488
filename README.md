About Project

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and testing are the main topics of this project. Any system must have testing, which may be done in a number of ways, including business user validation testing and corporate design team testing. To demonstrate the testing, UiPath Studio will be used. RPA is the process of using technology to replicate human work in a way that is comparable to how an individual would perform a task. UiPath Orchestrator will host the robot.To illustrate the testing, we will use the hosted https://techtrendstelemetryportal.azurewebsites.net/. I used the Microsoft Edge to demonstrate the automation. The robot will input data into the Web application's database by reading from an Excel spreadsheet.The data testResults sheet can be updated by the robot to reflect the modifications it has made or executed automatically.
